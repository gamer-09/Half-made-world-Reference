# Half-Made World — Reference

**[Open the live archive →](https://gamer-09.github.io/Half-made-world-Reference/)**

Reference archive for the *Half-Made World* fantasy novel — a searchable, editable knowledge base
for its lore, magic systems, and characters, built as an interactive web app so world details never
have to live buried in a single document again.

## What's in this repo

- **`half-made-world-hub/`** — the interactive archive app (React + TypeScript + Vite client, dark
  fantasy themed UI; Node + Express server, persists to a JSON file on disk).
- **`Half_made world ideas.docx`** — the original source document. Everything in the hub was seeded
  from this file; it remains here as the canonical starting reference.

The archive holds **1090 entries across 57 categories** — Demon/Angel/Class/Hybrid Skills, Titles,
Rules & Notes, Characters, Classes, Class Progression, Grade System, Rune Star Circles, Monsters,
Rifts, Locations, Items, Magic Systems, Realms, Coins, Clan, Economy, Organizations, Calendar, Combat
Mechanics, Laws & Justice, Academy, and many more — all browsable, searchable, and editable through
the UI. **28 characters**, **4387 story links**, and **81 relationships** tie it all together.

## Quick start

```bash
cd half-made-world-hub
npm run install:all   # installs server + client
npm run dev            # server on :5001, client on :5173
```

Open http://localhost:5173. On the first run the server writes `server/data/*.json` from the
bundled seeds, which were transcribed from the reference document; every edit after that is made
and saved through the UI itself.

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Starts server + client dev servers |
| `npm run build` | Syncs the seeds, then typechecks and builds the client |
| `npm start` | Starts only the server (serves API) |
| `npm run install:all` | Installs dependencies for server and client |
| `npm run snapshot` | Rebuilds `client/public/snapshot.json` from `server/data/*.json` |
| `npm run sync:all` | Regenerates the seed files *and* the client snapshot from the live data |
| `npm run seeds:sync` | Regenerates the seed files only |
| `npm run seeds:check` | Exits non-zero if the seed files are out of sync with the data (used by CI) |
| `npm test --prefix client` | Runs the client unit tests (Vitest) |

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Focus the search box |
| `n` | Add an entry (local dev only — the deployed build shows a "view-only" toast) |
| `1` – `5` | Browse · Relationship Map · Story Web · Block Map · Query Chat |
| `6` – `9` | Planning · Canon Guard · Weave · Flavor Finder (local dev only) |

## Interface notes

- The backdrop is a real 3D world — a slowly turning planet lit by one sun, so the terminator
  sweeps across the three realms and the Hidden Realm where they meet, over a shader-driven
  aurora sky. It is rendered with three.js and degrades to a static gradient if the canvas
  cannot start.
- A lo-fi player sits in the header; it is on by default and remembers your choice.
- The archive keeps a "recently opened" list in `localStorage`, and the search box matches
  names, subtitles, descriptions, tags, and field values.

## Data model

Each entry has:

- `category` — which section it belongs to (Realms, Monsters, Classes, Items, …)
- `name` + `subtitle` — the title and a one-line tagline
- `description` — the main text
- `fields` — structured key/value details (e.g. Rank, Appearance, Skills)
- `tags` — freeform search tags

## Relationship Map

A dedicated **Relationship Map** view shows named characters as nodes and their connections as
colored, arrowed edges — who knows whom, who loves whom, who betrayed whom.

- **Drag** characters to rearrange the layout.
- **Hover** a character to trace all of its links; dim everything else.
- **Click a character** to open their full archive entry.
- **Click an edge** to read its story (with edit/delete actions).
- **Add relationships** through a structured form (source, target, type, label, notes) — types drive
  edge colors, e.g. `betrayed`, `ordered killed`, `right-hand of`, `unaware of`.

Relationships persist in `server/data/relationships.json`.

## Story Web

A **Story Web** page shows the *whole story* as one interactive map — every realm, location,
monster, being, rank, item, artifact, character, and plot thread as a node, connected by **4387**
colored, arrowed links like `located in`, `guards`, `rules`, `kills`, `sealed in`, `crafted by`, and
`story of`. Character relationship links are merged in too.

- **Category chips** above the map toggle whole categories on/off (e.g. hide Classes to declutter).
- **Drag** any node to rearrange; **hover** traces its connections; **click** a node opens its entry;
  **click** a link reads its story (with edit/delete).
- Node ring colors match the archive category colors; link colors match their type legend.
- **Add links** through the same structured form as relationships (any entry name is suggested).

Story links persist in `server/data/story-links.json`.

## Block Map

A **Block Map** view renders the world's geography as a rightward-flowing "blockchain": a genesis
block for *The World* sits at the far left, with each realm/category laid out as its own horizontal
chain of blocks (children in breadth-first order), packed left-to-right so the map grows wide rather
than tall. Realms and containment links (`located in`, `lives in`, `home of`, `part of`) drive the
hierarchy.

- **Scroll** to zoom, **drag** to pan, **hover** to trace a chain, **click** a block to open its
  entry, **Esc** to fit the whole map to screen.

## Query Chat (AI)

A **Query Chat** view lets you ask the archive plain-language questions. Its **query mode** is a
local keyword lookup — no AI is involved, and it works without any key. Its **explore mode** is
Groq-backed: it sends the whole archive to the server's `/api/ai/explore` route to have the AI find
the answer itself. Explore **always uses the HTTP (Groq) backend** and requires `AI_API_KEY` (or
`GROQ_API_KEY`) in the server environment; without a key, explore falls back to the local lookup.

## Canon Guard (local dev only)

A **Canon Guard** view audits the archive for internal consistency and reports what it finds.
It is **report-only** — it never writes to the archive. The rules it runs:

| Rule | What it catches |
| --- | --- |
| `CONTRADICTION` | Conflicting "first / only" claims about a unique thing |
| `BROKEN-REF` | Story-link or relationship endpoints that resolve to no entry |
| `DUPLICATE` | Two entries sharing a name |
| `DRIFT` | Near-identical entry names (typo / casing / spacing variants) |
| `GAP` | Truncated or empty descriptions |
| `META` | Meta-commentary or placeholder language in canon text |
| `ORPHAN` | An entry with no story link in either direction |
| `SUGGESTED-LINK` | An entry named in the text that has an entry of its own but no link to it |

Findings can be acknowledged so a re-run keeps them dismissed, and each finding links straight to
the entry it concerns. Passing a `draft` entry to `/api/canon/lint` scopes the audit to that
entry's neighbourhood instead of the whole archive.

## Weave (local dev only)

**Weave** is a playful way through the archive with three panels:

- **Timeline Explorer** — the world's eras (the Age of the Aelthar, the Sundering, the First and
  Second Turnings, the Academy Era, and the rest), each with the events that define it.
- **Constellation** — the archive as a 2D graph; nodes are entries, sized by how well connected
  they are, with story links solid and relationships dashed. Switch between the current era and
  the whole archive.
- **Lore Oracle** — draws a random entry from the era and opens it.

## Flavor Finder (local dev only)

**Flavor Finder** is a small writing tool with four modes, all pure AI — no archive data is sent
and nothing is written:

- **Descriptors** — a word, phrase, or action in, evocative one- or two-word descriptors out.
- **Enrich a scene** — paste a scene, get the same scene rewritten with more life.
- **Scene craft** — ask how to handle a transition, a time jump, or a POV change.
- **Sounds** — a sound source in, the sound words for it out ("boom", "thud").

It reuses the same HTTP backend as Query Chat's explore mode, so it needs `AI_API_KEY` (or
`GROQ_API_KEY`).

## Planning Room (AI, local dev only)

A **Planning Room** view drafts *new* entries — characters, places, races, monsters, factions,
items, even whole new categories — that fit the world already written. It reads the whole archive
(its structure, field conventions, and every existing entry) so new material matches the archive's
tone and canon.

The flow is questions-first: the planner asks the open creative decisions it needs (motive, tone,
name, scope, which existing entries it ties to), then writes a full draft once you answer — or
draft it its own way. Drafts are **never saved**: they are ephemeral proposals shown only in the
local dev UI, and where a detail is your call rather than something the archive answers, the
planner asks instead of inventing it.

Planning is **gated to local development** (`import.meta.env.DEV`): the nav button, shortcut `6`,
and the view itself are absent from the deployed read-only build.

> **The planner is currently switched off.** `AI_PLANNER_ENABLED` defaults to `false`, because the
> opencode run over the whole archive is not dependable yet — it can run for minutes and then answer
> with prose instead of the requested JSON. The view is still there and shows a "switched off"
> panel. Set `AI_PLANNER_ENABLED=true` in `.env` to bring it back; the implementation is
> untouched.

### Choosing the AI backend

The AI features use **two separate backends**, and each is wired to a fixed one:

- **Explore (Query Chat) and Flavor Finder** — always the **HTTP backend**, by default Groq. Set
  `AI_API_KEY` (or `GROQ_API_KEY`) to enable it. `AI_BASE_URL` / `AI_MODEL` point at any
  OpenAI-compatible chat-completions endpoint (Groq is the default; OpenRouter and local
  Ollama/LM Studio all work), and `AI_FALLBACK_MODELS` tries additional models in order when a
  free model is rate-limited. These never use the opencode CLI.
- **Planning Room** — always the **local `opencode` CLI** (set nothing beyond having opencode
  installed; `opencode run --format json` drives it). It uses whatever model/auth opencode is
  configured with, so no API key is needed. `OPENCODE_MODEL` pins a model, `OPENCODE_BIN`
  overrides the binary path, `OPENCODE_AGENT` picks the agent (default `plan`), and
  `OPENCODE_TIMEOUT_MS` caps one CLI call. The planner does **not** fall back to HTTP — if the
  opencode CLI fails, the plan request fails.

`AI_PROVIDER` is no longer needed to switch between them: explore is always HTTP and the planner is
always opencode. The only relevant knobs are the keys above and the optional opencode overrides.

The full-archive digest the planner reads is bounded by `AI_FULL_CONTEXT_BUDGET` (default
`150000` characters; set `0` to fall back to keyword matches only).

Two optional toggles apply to the HTTP backend only: `AI_REASONING=true` sends `reasoning_effort`
(Groq and gpt-oss models only), and `AI_JSON_MODE=false` disables JSON response mode. See
`.env.example` for the full list.

## World systems (as captured in the archive)

- **Ranks & roles** — angel and demon rank (Serapharch↔Lumen, Mordrach↔Gnash) measures *power*, not
  *profession*; most beings are civilians and any rank can leave the realm.
- **Grades (G–S)** — the universal power scale, with Early/Mid/Late/Peak sub-stages, the Wall, and
  Evolution Quests. Max level is 100.
- **Rune Star Circles (1–7)** — Mages progress by inscribing Rune Stars into their heart instead of
  using the Grade system; each circle maps to a rough Grade equivalent (1st≈F … 7th≈S).
- **Classes (19)** — Veyn and Ren classes, each with 10 class-skills and a 7-tier progression
  ladder. Angels/demons learn max 5 class-skills; humans learn all. Veyn & Ren can't mix (Smithing
  is the sole exception; angels/demons may unlock a Ren Organ at the cost of all Veyn).
- **Magic** — Veyn (neutral) → Holy Energy (angels/saints) and Corrupted Veyn (demons); Ren → Auric
  Ren (paladins).
- **Currency** — Sigils: 100 silver = 1 gold, 1,000 gold = 1 platinum.
- **Reference document** — `Half_made world ideas.docx` is the original source the archive was
  transcribed from. The live `server/data/*.json` files are the source of truth; the bundled seed
  data is synced from them with `npm run seeds:sync` (or verified with `npm run seeds:check`).

## Tests and CI

The client has a Vitest suite (`npm test --prefix client`) covering the search index, the
description renderer and markdown tables, the canon rules, the Flavor Finder, and the Weave eras.

Every push to `main` runs the GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy-ghpages.yml`:
it installs the client dependencies, runs the unit tests, checks that the seed files still match
`server/data/*.json` (`npm run seeds:check`), builds the client, and deploys `client/dist` to
GitHub Pages. The same workflow is what keeps the live archive in step with the committed data.
